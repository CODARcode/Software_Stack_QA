# Savanna Cori Install Notes

Before installing anything from scratch, check for an up to date install in
`/global/project/projectdirs/m3084/`. To update or create a new configuration,
use the following as a starting point. Before building anything, switch to the
gnu compiler chain:
```
module sw PrgEnv-intel PrgEnv-gnu
```
TODO: consider doing `module unload darshan` first.

1. Install EVPath and related libraries using
    [Korvo Bootstrap](https://gtkorvo.github.io/). Consider using a shared
    location in `/global/project/projectdirs/m3084/`.
    ```
    wget â€“q https://gtkorvo.github.io/korvo_bootstrap.pl
    perl ./korvo_bootstrap.pl stable /global/project/projectdirs/m3084/your/sw/directory
    perl ./korvo_build.pl
    ```

2. Install [spack](http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html)
    from the `CODARcode` fork and `codar-theta` branch (not a typo - branch
    includes changes for both theta and cori):
    ```
    git clone --branch codar-theta git@github.com:CODARcode/spack.git
    ```
    Note: use the codar branch once these changes have been merged.

3. Copy `packages.yaml` from this directory to `~/.spack/packages.yaml`.
 Edit korvo paths to point at location of installed GTkorvo libraries.

4. Install adios and dependencies using spack. Note that this will use the
    cray system MPI and other standard tools, as well as the GTkorvo libraries
    built above if packages.yaml is set up correctly. It will also use the
    versions and variants specified in that file, so they don't need to be
    set in the install line.
    ```
    spack install adios
    ```

5. Checkout and build heat transfer example using cluster-2018 branch:
    ```
    git checkout git@github.com:CODARcode/Example-Heat_Transfer.git
    cd Example-Heat_Transfer
    git checkout cluster-2018
    spack load adios bzip2 lz4 zfp mgard
    make
    cd stage_write
    make
    cd ..
    ```
